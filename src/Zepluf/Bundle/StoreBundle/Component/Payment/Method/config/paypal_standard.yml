# It can be "Order", "Authorization", and "Sale"
#
# Why would I use an "Authorization"?
# An Authorization is used to put a hold on the funds. When you submit an
# Authorization you are asking PayPal to see if the funds are available,
# and if they are to place a hold on them for 3 days. You can capture an
# Authorization for up to 29 days, however the funds are only on hold for
# 3 days, these 3 days are known as the "honor period".
#
# Why would I use an "ORDER"?
# An "Order" is used when you are possibly looking at a backorder situation.
# Where you may or may not have all of the items from the buyers cart in
# stock or readily available. An order is (like the Authorization) valid
# for 29 days, however the big difference here is that the Order does NOT
# place a hold on the funds. It simply allows you to place a hold on the
# funds via an Authorization at a later time.
#
# Why would I use a PaymentAction of "Sale"?
# A PaymentAction of "Sale" is very straight forward. There is no hold on
# the funds, the payment is processed right then and there. This would be
# used for something that is delivered right away such as for Digital Goods,
# or if your product ships as soon as you receive the order.
