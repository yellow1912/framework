The Zencart Plugin Framework (ZePLUF) is a product of rubikin.com

This framework is meant to be used with Zencart version 1.3.9h and above

**Features**
- Allows developers to package their plugin(s) in one single place (in most cases) instead of spreading the files all over the place.
- Installing a Zencart plugin has never been easier, in many cases it's just a matter of uploading the new plugin folder. No more messing around with various Zencart folders.
- Files/Classes are loaded on demand with PHP 5.3 lazy load feature.
- Allows developers to save time while developing their modules by making use of the framework's useful features (such at the ability to inject content into any location)
- Many of our modules also rely on ZePLUF to work, you won't be able to use our modules without ZePLUF
